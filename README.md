### Description:
This flowchart application allows you to describe an algorithm or processes in which individual steps are represented as blocks connected by lines indicating the direction of the sequence. The mechanics of the application are implemented by moving div blocks across the surface of the layer, so that it can easily scale into a website builder or more complex flowcharts.
